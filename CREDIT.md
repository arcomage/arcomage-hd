[Ubisoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft) acquired the copyrights and trademarks for the _Might and Magic_ game series from [The 3DO Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_3DO_Company) after 3DO went bankrupt in 2003. However, Ubisoft did not acquire the rights to Arcomage. The 2000 stand-alone game Arcomage is now considered [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware), but it remains copyrighted. Arcomage also appeared as a mini-game in _Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor_ and _Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer_, which are owned by Ubisoft and are still sold actively.
