[Arcomage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcomage) game's assets, text and appearance are copyrighted, the logos and trademarks are held today by either Ubisoft or the defunct 3DO: [Ubisoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft) purchased [Might and Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic) game series' copyright and trademarks from [The 3DO Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_3DO_Company) when 3DO went bankrupt in 2003, but Ubisoft didn't purchased Arcomage. The 2000 stand-alone game Arcomage is now an [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware), but is still copyrighted. Arcomage did appear as a mini-game in *Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor* and *Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer*, which are owned by Ubisoft and are still sold actively.
